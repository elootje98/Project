First an overview is given on how many people are smoking in every country.
It's possible for the user to also see this for males and females seperately.

## Scatter plots
Since it's hard to keep an overview over the countries taxes, advertising bans
and the percentage of smokers, two scatterplots have been made. One containig the
parameters taxes and percentage of smokers. The other one containing advertising
bans and percentage of smokers.
