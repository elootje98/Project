##Problem
Smoking is avoidable cause of death number one. Governments try to reduce smoking under their inhabitants by taking various steps. For example, rising taxes or ban commercials for sigarettes. The logical question is therefore: “Are there less smokers in countries where the government takes action against smoking?”

##Solution
MVP: making a map with color coded how many smokers every country has. The user can hover over the countries to see the exact number of smokers. Also the user can select “Female”, “Male” or “Both”.
There will be a scatterplot with the two variables smokers and taxes on cigarettes. The scatterplot will update when clicking on a certain country. Also here the user can select “Female”, “Male” or “Both”.
I will also give all the countries points, based on how many bans the country has on advertising for cigarettes. I will plot these values in a barchart. When clicking on a country on the map, the selected country will be highlighted in the barchart.
Optional: the user can check checkboxes for the different kinds of advertising, then the corresponding countries will appear. Instead of using a map, a globe that the user can turn. Add time as an extra variable in the scatterplot.

Here the taxes on cigarettes in the USA are displayed on the map of the USA. I will probably also make a map, but then representing the number of smokers per country.

The timeline that is used could be a nice idea to implement as an extra.

##Hardest part
The hardest part will be to link all the visualizations and make sure the updates work and work smoothly.
