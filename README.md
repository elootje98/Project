## The effect of advertising bans and taxes on the percentage of smokers in a country.
This data visualization is made by Elodie Rijnja.

![](map.png)
First an overview is given on how many people are smoking in every country.
It's possible for the user to also see this for males and females seperately.

![](tax.png)
A country on the map can be clicked in order to see the corresponding average
% of taxes of cigarette price in that country. Different types of taxes can be
chosen.

Furthermore, after clicking a country on the map, there will be shown how many
advertising bans a country has.

Since it's hard to keep an overview over the countries taxes, advertising bans
and the percentage of smokers, two scatterplots have been made. One containig the
parameters taxes and percentage of smokers. The other one containing advertising
bans and percentage of smokers.

To make it more convenient for the user, there is a search bar. In this search
bar the user can type a country. After pressing the button, the scatter- and
spiderplot are updated to that country.
