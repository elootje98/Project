## Day 2
I made my design proposal.
In this drawing I show how I want to link my visualizations together and the
pseudocode I want to use to do that.

## Day 3
I started with making the html page. Also I made the different divs where my
vizualisations will be placed in later.

## Day 4
Today I added the buttons and drop down list to my html page.

## Day 5
I added a short introduction and made the map working.
