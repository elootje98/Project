          smoking are different all over the world, some religions even prohibit

          is extremely harmfull. Some governements take actions to protect their
          citizins against smoking.

          is said that rising taxes on tabacco, will make people less likely to
          smoke. On the other hand, critics say that raising taxes won't make
          a difference, but will only add an other problem: making tabacco addicts
          fall into poverty.
          In order to bring back the number of smokers, there needs to be
          clearification wether the current measures have effect.
