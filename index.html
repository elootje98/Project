        Every year 7 million people die due to tabacco use. Smoking has
        harming effects on nearly every organ in the human body. Views on
        smoking are different all over the world, some religions even prohibit
        smoking. However, more and more people start to realize that smoking
        is extremely harmfull. Some governements take actions to protect their
        citizins against smoking.
        For example, banning tabacco advertisement. Also, there
        is said that rising taxes on tabacco, will make people less likely to
        smoke. On the other hand, critics say that raising taxes won't make
        a difference, but will only add an other problem: making tabacco addicts
        fall into poverty.
        In order to bring back the number of smokers, there needs to be
        clearification wether the current measures have effect.
