              On this map you can see the percentage of smokers in every country.
              It looks like a high percentage of the population in Europe smokes
              tabacco daily. Also the country with the highest percentage lies
              in Europe: Greece (35.2%).
            </p>
            <p>
              Click on the buttons and see how the map changes color. When clicking
              on 'women' the map gets filled with much brighter colors. Overall,
              women smoke less than men. Some experts say that the amouth of
              women that smoke compareed to the males in that country, says
              something about the emancipation of that country. Observe how
              country colors change when switching between women and males.
              You will see that Western countries don't change that much in color.
              Nevertheless, countries like for example, Indonesia, change from yellow
              to dark red. In conclusion: in Western countries women contribute
              more to the total percentage of smokers than in other countries.

              Click on some countries on the map and see how the line graph
              changes. In the drop-down menu you can choose different kind
              of taxes. Take note of the fact that in Europe the hight of the
              taxes vary a lot between the countries. Greece, the country with
              the highest smokers percentage, has a total tax of 12.00%. However,
              they drastically rose this value to 42.90% in 2014.
              Be aware of the fact that the values in the map are from 2013, so
              the value of taxes in 2014 won't have effected the percentage of
              smokers on the map!
              If higher taxes would have an effect on the percentage of smokers,
              you would expect high taxes in countries with few smokers, and the
              other way around. However, for example in Germany there are relatively
              many smokers(24.2%), but the taxes are also high(35.80%).
              The oposite is seen in Mexico, with a smokers percentage of 8.3% and
              only 15.40% total tax.

              When clicking on a country on the map, also the spiderchart changes.
              On the axes the types of advertising bans are displayed.
              You would expect that in countries with little advertising for
              tabacco, there would be less smokers. This can be seen in Panama
              (3.9% smokers), where no advertisement is allowed. It's also interesting
              to see that Panama has a total tax of 0% on cigarettes.
              Hover, in Jordan, where there is also no advertisement allowed,
              has a smokers percentage of 31.0%.

              In this scatterplot the effect of taxes on the percentage of smokers
              is shown. It seems that taxes don't have an effect on the percentage
              of smokers. For example, in countries where there are no taxes on
              sigarettes, the percentage of smokers varies between 3.9% and 27.8%.
              However, the counry with the highest taxes (Singapore with 67.30%),
              has a low percentage of smokers(13.2%).

              advertising bans and the percentage of smokers can not be seen.
